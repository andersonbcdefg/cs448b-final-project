	<h1>Disease Burden vs. Comparable Countries</h1>
	<h2>"Disability-adjusted life years", or DALYs, are a measure of disease burdenâ€”the number of life-years lost due to bad health or early death. (Thus, more DALYs is worse.) The U.S. has historically been doing worse than comparable countries when it comes to disease burden. See if you can guess the trend for recent years.</h2>
