# CS448B Final Project

In this interactive data visualization, I explore how healthcare in America has (and hasn't) changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
The interactive demo can be found [here](https://448b-final-project.netlify.app/).

This repository contains code for data analysis/preparation, the skeletons of each "slide" in the interactive presentation, and the Javascript/D3 brains 
that power the visualization demonstrations. Data preparation is found in the `r code` folder. Data is in `src/data`. D3 and Javascript code for 
various visualizations is in `src/js`. Individual HTML-like templates for each page (written in Nunjucks) are in `src/pages`.
